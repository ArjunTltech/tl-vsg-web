      text: `VS GenX Solutions was founded with a clear mission—to empower businesses and individuals through purpose-driven, scalable HR solutions. The journey began in 2018, when Venkatesan Srinivasan started VS Strategic Business Consultant as a freelance HR advisor.
    
    Over the next few years, he collaborated with 10+ SMEs and 5+ startups, helping them establish HR foundations, policies, compliance frameworks, leadership development initiatives, and talent management strategies. His expertise extended to headhunting CXO-level roles, particularly in Aerospace, IT, GCC, and Material Handling Equipment (MHE) industries.
    
    Recognizing the growing role of Digital HR and AI-driven HR automation, Venkatesan also began integrating HR technology solutions into his consulting practice, enabling businesses to streamline HR operations and enhance workforce efficiency.
    
    However, in 2018, he chose to pause consulting and took on a full-time role as Global Head of HR at KNOT Solutions. While this role further refined his ability to lead enterprise-wide HR transformation, his deeper purpose—to empower talented individuals from underprivileged communities—remained at the forefront of his aspirations. Realizing it was now or never, he made the decision to return to his mission full-time, leading to the creation of VS GenX Solutions.
    
    In just the past six months, VS GenX Solutions has:
    
    • Served as an On-Demand HR Leader for 5+ SMEs, driving cost-effective, technology-enabled HR strategies.  
    • Empowered 50+ professionals through the flagship Ready for Next Theatre-Based Leadership Program, helping leaders navigate change, innovation, and business transformation.  
    • Designed and implemented AI-driven HR automation solutions, optimizing talent acquisition, workforce analytics, and employee engagement for growing businesses.
    
    Today, VS GenX Solutions is reshaping HR for startups and SMEs by blending human expertise with digital intelligence—delivering scalable, inclusive, and high-impact HR solutions while staying true to our mission of creating equal opportunities for all.`,
